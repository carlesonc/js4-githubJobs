<!-- Todo:
    -   Add an input field where the user can enter something to search for.

    -   Add a button to trigger the search.

    -   The API expects "spaces" to be changed to "plus-signs".
        -   If a user searchs for "react javascript", change the string
            to "react+javascript".

    -   When the user searchs for a specific term (description), list the result
        returned from the API.

    -   Make sure that the type value returned from the API is contained in
        a strong-element.

    -   Make sure that the title value returned from the API is contained in a h2-element.

    -   Make sure that the company_url value returned from the API is contained in a a-element.

    -   Make sure that the description value returned from the API is contained in a p-element or a div-element.

    -   Make sure that the company_logo value returned from the API is added to the src attribute
        for a img-element.

    -   If the API returns an empty array, make sure to show a message to the users with the
        following text: "Nojobsfound".

    -   Write tests to make sure that all the components in your project are working as expected
        (atleast10 tests).

    -   Create at least three components: JobList,  JobItem,    Image. (Optional)

    -   VG (all of the below should be developed to receive the higher grade):

        -   When the user clicks on a job posting the user is redirected to the detail page
            for that job posting.

        -   Save the result from the API in context, check if the value the user is searching for is already in context, if so, return it from context instead for fetching it again.

        -   Deploy application to any hosting site (githubpages, netlify, firebase, vercel etc.
